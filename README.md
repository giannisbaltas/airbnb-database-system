# Database Systems

### Description

This repository holds all the assignments and the final project for the Databases course.

We used PostgreSQL and primarily pgAdmin (a GUI for PSQL as an alternative to the CLI) to manage our database, which was not hosted locally, but on an Amazon AWS endpoint.

From an overview, this series of assignments were an amazing practice for real database design and management. However, there were many flaws and errors that made our job challenging.
