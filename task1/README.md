# First & Second Assignment

In this series of assignments we had to edit and maintain a real database that holds AirBNB data for hostings, reservations, ratings, geolocation and more.

We started in the first assignment by creating the PostgreSQL database, using AWS for hosting, installing pgAdmin, connecting to the database and creating some users with different rights.

In the second assignment we had to create different tables from a dataset of CSV files, which was done automatically through a python script that reads a CSV file and outputs a SQL CREATE TABLE statement. Then, we had to create the tables in our database and import the data from the CSV files into the corresponding tables. The database's schema should also be shown in a ER diagram.
